ledger (2.6.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * CONSTipate gnucash.cc, textual.cc, and option.cc, so it builds with GCC
    4.4.  Thanks to Stefan Ebner for the patch.  Closes: #547303.
  * Install a man page (this will become redundant once 3.0 comes out, but
    until then...).  Thanks to Carl Worth for the manpage.  Closes: #540409.
  * Install emacs mode for ledger (ledger.el); untested, as I have no emacs
    fu, but here's hoping... Thanks to Kevin Ryde for the patch.
    Closes: #554040.
  * Bumped standards version; no changes required.
