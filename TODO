** DONE [#A] Command-line options don't always override init-file options
   - State "DONE"       [2009-01-21 Wed 18:53] \\
     Fixed by changing the order in which options are read:
     
       1. Global defaults
       2. Environment variable settings
       3. Initialization file
       4. Command-line arguments
     
     Whatever is later in the list overrides what is earlier.

   - State "DONE"       [2009-01-20 Tue 21:02] \\
     Fixed in 2.6.2.
   If I use %2.2X in a format string, I would expect to either get the string
   "! ", the string "* " or " ", but for the non-cleared case, it doesn't print
   any spaces, and the columns don't line up.  Other optional formatting (such
   as %C) seem to work with width indicators.

   I've worked around this by putting the %X as the last thing in the register,
   but it would be nice to be able to see it next to the amounts.

** DONE [#B] When --no-cache is used, a file named '<none>' is being written out
   - State "DONE"       [2009-01-20 Tue 21:02] \\
     Fixed in 2.6.2.
   I'm running off of the v2.6.1 tag in git.  I occasionally find that the
   ledger cache has a few problems, usually causing transactions to have the
   wrong sign.  I haven't figured out exactly how to reproduce this.
   
   I've put --no-cache in my ~/.ledgerrc, but this seems to just cause it to
   write the cache to a file in the current directory called "<none>".  I'm not
   sure if it reads the file or not.

    There was a problem with the -e date parsing.  I now interpret "-e june"
    to mean that you want the report to end AT June, rather than IN June.

  The release (2.6.0.90) doesn't seem to properly parse dates.  The svn
  version (rev. 1048) works fine for full dates (yyyy/mm/dd) with the -b -e
  params but nothing else works.  For example in the following only the last
  one works:
  :SCRIPT:

** DONE [#C] Entry command doesn't match debit account when description is unmatched
  - State "DONE"       [2008-07-20 Sun 20:32]
  I think I've isolated a bug with the entry command where I get "Equity"
  instead of a valid debit account:
  :OUTPUT:
$ ledger entry 2008/07/18 "Pei Wei" food 20 checking

2008/07/18 Pei Wei
    Expenses:Food:Out                        $ 20.00
    Assets:Checking

$ ledger entry 2008/07/18 "Foo Bar" food 20 checking

2008/07/18 Foo Bar
    Expenses:Food                            $ 20.00
    Equity
  :END:

  The first command proves that ledger understands I have an `Assets:Checking`
  account.  That's because I already have entries for `Pei Wei`.

  If I enter a description that doesn't match a previous entry, it doesn't
  match `checking` to `Assets:Checking`.

    This is a known bug that was fixed in 2.6.  If you need a back-patch for
    2.4.1, please let me know.
  We have ledger-2.4 in the ports, but it segfaults on freebsd-8 (the current
  dev version of the OS).  The backtrace is incoherent, because the libs are
  stripped and we have no symbols.  Anyway, a sane person would want a more
  recent ledger.  The tarball exhibits the exact same problem as the one from
  SVN:

  I know C and i can do some gdb(1), but i don't have the C++ knowledge to
  even fix this one.  It looks not all that complicated.  Maybe a little patch
  could help the C++ compiler to figure out the type inference.

  I used emacs for quite some time, but got annoyed with its ancient lisp.  So
  using the common lisp version is currently not an option for me, and without
  emacs one has to type way to much for some little reports.  Could you please
  bring the C++ version into a usable state again?  perhaps it's not that much
  work?

    The extra penny crept in because of the way that commodity have "lot" details

** WONTFIX [#B] Problem with pricing specification in prices.db file
  - State "WONTFIX"    [2008-07-17 Thu 21:42] \\
    Pricing info is not used for balancing entries.  For that, you'd need to use
    "@ ... USD" for the halfg and gouda amounts, so that Ledger could be certain
    your entries balances to zero.
  - State "TODO"       [2008-04-05 Sat 20:09] \\
    I changed it to this below, and ledger stopped complaining: 
    :DATA:
2007/03/07 Irena 
    Liabilities:Cash:Irena 7.00 USD 
    Liabilities:Order1:Irena -1 gouda 

2007/03/07 Irena 
    Liabilities:Cash:Irena 11.00 USD 
    Liabilities:Order1:Irena -4 halfg 
    :END:
  :OUTPUT:
djw@hector:~$ ledger bal 

2007/03/07 Irena 
    Liabilities:Cash:Irena 18.00 USD 
    Liabilities:Order1:Irena -4 halfg 
    Liabilities:Order1:Irena -1 gouda 
Error: /home/djw/milk.ledger, line 106: Entry above does not balance; remainder is: 18.00 USD 
-1 gouda 
-4 halfg
  :END:
  Here is what is in the prices.db file: 
  :DATA:
C 1.00 USD = $1.21 
P 2007/03/04 00:00:00 halfg 2.75 USD 
P 2007/03/04 00:00:00 gouda 7 USD 
  :END:
  So you multiply 4*2.75 and add 7, you get 18. Since the units are USD, what
  is the beef? Why isn't ledger seeing 1 gouda and 4 halfg as 18 USD?

** WORKSFORME [#B] Problems with the prices.db file

    Pricing entries must start with a capital P, not a lowercase p.

    This bug also mentions other issues, which are now contained in another
    bug.
  - State "TODO"       [2008-04-05 Sat 20:06] \\
    However, even though I do not receive parse errors any longer, the
    price-db command does not work the way I expect it to. When I issue a
    'bal' option, ledger still outputs the values in their commodity rather
    than the dollar amount, so even though I am not receiving an error, it
    still does not seem to work for me.
  My prices.db file looks like: 
  :DATA:
p 2007/01/14 02:18:01 WMCVX $5.04 
p 2007/01/14 02:18:02 WMICX $6.65
  :END:
  Notice there is no carriage return after the second line and that the file
  begins on line 1.
  
  When I run 'ledger --price-db prices.db bal' I get the following: 
  :OUTPUT:
Error: prices.db, line 2: Failed to parse dateP 
Error: Errors parsing file 'life/finances/ledger/prices.db' 
  :END:

  If I have a carriage return on the second line, I get errors for both line 2
  and line 3. If i have one entry on a single line, I get an error for line 2.
  
  Any ideas? 
  
  Also, I would like to get the prices.db perl script working to automatically
  grab the values from Fidelity, but I have not been able to do anything
  beyond installing the appropriate perl modules. If there are any
  instructions for this usage, I would appreciate it.

    This has been fixed, see the comments in #36.
  I'm using the latest source from CVS and it appears the `-e` option is
  broken.  For example this works as expected:
  :OUTPUT:
% ledger -b 2006/05/01 bal
  :END:

But this does not.  No output whatsoever:
  :OUTPUT:
% ledger -b 2006/05/01 -e 2006/05/31 bal
  :END:

This also doesn't work.  It just shows `Opening Balances: 0`:
  :OUTPUT:
% ledger -p "last month" bal

     Duplicated by #64.
   I've tried version 2.5 but have had some problems.

   I use Carbon Emacs on Mac OS X to edit my Ledger files.  Unfortunately the
   reconcile functionality doesn't work any more.  Pressing the space bar
   doesn't always toggle an entry, sometimes it needs to be pressed twice,
   sometimes it never goes.  Additionally, even if some entries are toggled,
   nothing is changed in the main file and pressing C-c C-c just re-sets the
   reconcile window back to it's original state.

   I've tried with and without the new ledger-clear-whole-entries variable set.
